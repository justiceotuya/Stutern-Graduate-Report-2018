                    <p>For the second year in a row, Stutern has tapped into the data of recent
                        Nigerian graduates (those who graduated within the last five years) to reveal insights into
                        Nigerian graduates
                        employment status, as well as the hiring
                        and the education market more generally. Because Stutern facilitates the
                        transition from the four walls of the schools to the labor market for thousands of young
                        Nigerians,
                        we have a unique
                        visibility across a variety of positions
                        and companies.<br>
                        Since our release of the debut edition of Stuternâ€™s Nigerian Graduate Report,
                        youth unemployment in Nigeria has reached its peak. This second edition
                        of the Nigerian Graduate Report is part of our larger effort to bring more
                        transparency into the state of graduate employment in Nigeria. Ultimately,
                        we want to use this report to prompt all stakeholders to be aware of the
                        importance of skills development and job creation to build a more productive
                        youth population.</p>

                    The majority of recent graduates aspire to find a job as soon as they
                    graduate, but do they actually find one? According to our survey, majority of
                    graduates who completed their studies within the last five years are currently
                    unemployed (28.9% ) while 26.3% are working in a full time paid employment.
                    About 1 in 6 respondents (16%) reported that they are observing the one year
                    mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) program. While 13.4% are
                    practicing entrepreneurship, freelance and other self employment activities,
                    8% are involved in voluntary and other unpaid employment. The remaining
                    7.2% are engaged or preparing for further studies.
